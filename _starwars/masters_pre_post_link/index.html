				As the name implies, the link function is responsible for linking the model
				to the templates. This is where Angular does its data binding to compiled
				templates.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are five parameters in the link funciton:<br>
				<em>link: function (scope, element, attributes, controller, transcludeFn){ }</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				Properties defined on the scope within the link function are linked to the
				template once the link function executes. Angular allows us to turn link into
				an object that can be split into two separate methods called pre-link and post-link.
			</p>
			<p>
				The link function is run by default as a post-link method. Most of the time we don't
				even need to think about it. The signature is of the pre-link function is same as
				that of a post-link; the only difference between them is the order in which they get
				executed.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a directive contains child directives, all of the child directiveâ€™s link
				functions execute first then the parent directive link function. This can create
				issues where you can't capture scope properties on the parent with the child. This
				is where pre-link comes in handy. A parent directive's pre-link will execute
				before all of its child directive functions.
			</p>
			<h4>Pre-link and post-link flow:</h4>
			<h4>
				Parent:pre-link ==> Child:pre-link ==> Grandchild:pre-link <br>
				Parent:post-link <== Child:post-link <== Grandchild:post-link
			</h4>
